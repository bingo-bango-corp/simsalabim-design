Simsalabim is Bingo Bango's UI library of Vue components.

Just install it like this `yarn add simsalabim-design` and then import the components like this `import 'simsalabim-design'` in your `main.js` or as a nuxt plugin or whatever. The package automatically registers all components globally so you just go ahead and use them in your templates.
